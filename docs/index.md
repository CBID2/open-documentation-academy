# Open Documentation Academy

Canonical's Open Documentation Academy (CODA) is an initiative to help foster open source development.

We combine Canonicalâ€™s documentation team with documentation newcomers, experts, and those in-between, to help us all improve documentation, become better writers, and better open source contributors.

We want to lower the barrier to successful open-source software contributions, by making documentation into the gateway, and to set the example for welcoming and constructive collaboration.

## How it works

* Find a [task](https://github.com/canonical/open-documentation-academy/issues) that you're interested in _(there are many)_
* Ask to be assigned the task _(no obligations)_
* Work on the task with the help support of our mentors _(we're friendly)_
* Finish, and get recognition for your work _(expand your CV and help open source)_

If you're a newcomer, we can provide help, advice, mentorship, and a hundred different tasks to get started on.

If you're an expert, we want to create a place to share knowledge, a place to get involved with new developments, and somewhere you can ask for help on your own projects. We'd also like to encourage new projects to get involved, and become sources of their own tasks on the Academy.

## Our documentation

Our documentation offers guidance to contributors looking to enter the world of
open-source and project maintainers who want to surface their documentation
issues to new contributors.
