# Canonical Open Documentation Academy

```{Note}
The CODA website is under active development.
We expect more and better content to be included soon!
```

The Canonical Open Documentation Academy or "CODA" is an initiative to
encourage community participation in open-source software.

Open-source software depends on contributions from the community but it can be
overwhelming for new contributors to find a way to get started.

CODA presents documentation issues from open-source projects and offers
contributors expert guidance when working on their solution.

This website offers guidance to contributors looking to enter the world of
open-source and project maintainers who want to surface their documentation
issues to new contributors.
