# What is CODA?

CODA acts as an interface between contributors and multiple open-source
projects.

Projects enrolled in the Academy can create issues for community members to
find. A list of these issues is publicly available on GitHub.

Community members can search for the topics that interest them most. After an
issue gets assigned to a community member they receive continuous feedback and
advice as they work on their open-source contribution.

The process is a virtuous circle, where the community member develops their
skill as an open-source contributor and projects benefit from improvements to
its documentation.
