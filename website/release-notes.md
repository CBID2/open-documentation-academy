_What's new in the Open Documentation Academy_

**February 28, 2025** Our first version of the proposed Documentation Academy website has gone live. This is more of a prototype than a final design, but we want to work on this as a collaborative effort with the community.

**February 27 2025** We now finally have a page dedicated to recognising the work of our amazing contributors. This currently is little more than a list, but we'd like to expand upon this and also formalise a framework for different levels of contribution.
