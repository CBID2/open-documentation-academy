# How To Review Someone's Work

When you first start your technical writing journey, one of the many important skills you'll need to learn is how to do is peer reviews. It's a skill that will not only teach you how to collaborate with other technical writers and other people who interact with documentation, but it will also help you to become a better technical writer in the long run.

## Peer Reviews vs. Code Reviews: What's the difference?

Even though peer reviews and code reviews are often used interchangeably, there are some key differences between the two. Peer reviews are often more personal and more focused on the quality of the work, while code reviews are more focused on the quality of the code.

## Tips for doing effective Peer Reviews

When it comes to peer reviews, there are a few things that you can do to make them more effective. Here are some tips:

- **Categorize the kind of feedback you're giving:** Use the feedback template to categorize the kind of feedback you're giving. For example, if you are asking the reader a question about the content, you would use the following template:

```markdown
[question]: what is the purpose of this section?
```

This method will make it easier for the reader to understand what you're asking them to do.

- **Be objective as much as possible:** Behind every piece of documentation is a person, so it's crucial to be mindful of your wording and tone when giving feedback. For example, if you noticed that a section is missing a code snippet or a key detail about the product, it would be ineffective to say, "This section stinks." Consider pointing out the strengths of the work and the areas that could be improved. For example, "this section describes the steps effectively, but the screenshots are missing alt text."

- **Be clear and specific:** When giving feedback, be clear about what you're looking for. For example, if you noticed that the content is missing a code snippet, you should say, "this section is missing a code snippet." as opposed to "this section is missing content."
- **Be concise:** While getting every detail correct is important, don't go overboard with your feedback. The person you're giving feedback might get overwhelmed with too much information. Keep it short and to the point. For example, if you're asking the reader to explain a concept, keep it to one sentence or two.
