# How to create an issue

For the projects enrolled, participating in CODA starts with finding a problem
in your product documentation. Once you find something you can then go to the
CODA repo on GitHub and create an issue. The issue description should clearly
outline the problem, where to find the documentation and indicate what the
solution might look like.

You then need to make the source available for the community to work on. There
are a few ways to do this. A common approach, and one that we recommend, is to
copy any relevant files and assets to the CODA repo itself. This requires that
you add a dedicated folder for issues relating to your product documentation to
the CODA repo. The first time you or a member of your team is adding files and
assets you will also create this folder. You only need to do it once.

If your project is enrolled with CODA then you should also make sure to submit
a PR to add your team as a contributing product in the README of the repo.

## Steps

Assuming you have a GitHub account already, the steps to create an issue on the
CODA repo are:

1. Find the CODA repository
2. Click on the Issues tab and select New Issue
3. Give a brief title that starts with your product name
3. Describe clearly the background of the issue
4. Identify any prerequisites needed by a contributor
5. Link to the documentation that is hosted publicly
6. Link to your contributing guidelines, if available
7. Attach any appropriate tags
8. Wait until someone responds
10. Discuss the issue with anyone who has interested and assign it to them
11. Provide support to the contributor to ensure a successful collaboration
