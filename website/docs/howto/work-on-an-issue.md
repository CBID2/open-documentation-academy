# How to work on an issue

When you find an issue that you want to work on,
post a comment on the issue to express your interest.

The creator of the issue will acknowledge your response and — if you both agree
— assign the issue to you.

You are now committed to working on the issue. The team of technical authors
and engineers at Canonical who are participating in CODA are also committed to
helping you do so successfully.

At this point, you should give a rough estimate of how long the work will take.
The estimate does not have to be 100% accurate and it can be revised later.

The person who created the issue may check in on your progress if you haven't
provided an update in a while. If there is no activity for several weeks the
issue may need to be relabelled as "unassigned".

When you're ready, submit a Pull Request to the CODA repo.
You will then get feedback and may need to make additional changes.
All going well, your contribution will be merged to the CODA repo.
