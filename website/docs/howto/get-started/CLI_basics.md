# Command line cheaty-cheats

Working on the command line takes a little getting used to, but doesn't need too much practice to get comfortable with it.

|||
| -- | -- |
| `cd <folder>` | Change directory down to `<folder>` |
| `cd ..` | Go back up one directory level |
| `ls` (or `ls -all`) | Lists all files (including hidden files) |
| `touch <file name>` | Create an empty file called `<file name>` |
| `rm <file name>` | Remove the file called `<file name>` |
| `code <file name>` | Open the named file in VS Code |


Although you can use the sequence:

```bash
touch <file name>
code <file name>
```

To create and then open an empty file, if you use `code <file name>` directly without creating the file first, VS code will create the file for you.
