# Getting started as a contributor

This set of guides is intended for anyone who wants to contribute more substantial changes to documentation (or on a more regular basis) using the Ubuntu command line. 

For quick corrections to a page, it's perfectly fine to use the GitHub web interface instead! 

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this guide, you will need to set up [a GitHub account](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.
The GitHub documentation is rather good, if you get stuck or need any explanation of particular topics.

## Getting your environment set up

If you're using a Windows machine, start by following these instructions:

  * [Getting started using Windows](start_with_WSL.md).

Continue as follows whether you are using Windows or Ubuntu.

1. [Install and configure git](install_git.md)
1. [Working with git on the command line](using_git.md)

If you are working on a project that uses Sphinx to render the documentation, continue with:

  * [Set up Sphinx](setup_sphinx.md)

## Reference ##

This reference will remind you of the basic commands needed to work with files on the command line.

  * [Command line cheat sheet](CLI_basics.md)
